In this first chapter we will explore data visualization with **ggplot2**; navigating variables, distribution, plots, and varying aesthetic options.

## Prerequisites
Install necessary packages to access datasets and plotting functions --> **just copy the commands into your own quarto notebook**

```{r prerequisites}
# install tidyverse package (only need to do once)
install.packages("tidyverse")
# run tidyverse package (need to run every time code is being run)
library(tidyverse)

# install and load palmerpenguins package which includes example datasets
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)

# install and load ggthemes package which offers colorblind safe color palette
install.packages("ggthemes")
library(ggthemes)
```

## Background Info

- A data frame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows). In the context of **palmerpenguins**, a variable refers to an attribute of all the penguins, and an observation refers to all the attributes of a single penguin.
- In the tidyverse, we use special data frames called **tibbles**
