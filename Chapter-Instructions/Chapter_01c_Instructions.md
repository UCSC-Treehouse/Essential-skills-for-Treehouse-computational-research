# Chapter 01c, GitHub


**That was a lot!** Now, to wrap up Chapter 1 you will learn to use
GitHub to make your work viewable to others (and also reproducible!) You
will create a new branch on GitHub and push your Chapter 1 work to that
branch, creating a pull request in the process. This pull request will
allow a mentor to review your work each chapter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember that Chapter 1 branch you created? After you save your Quarto
notebook, you are going to push all of your new Chapter 1 changes to
that branch on GitHub, so your work will be viewable on the
UCSC-Treehouse organization.

Lastly, you will request your mentor as a ‘reviewer’, so they can check
over your work *before* you officially push it to the main branch.

Navigate back to **GitHub Desktop**… You should see your new changes
highlighted in red.

1.  Push new Chapter 1 changes to chapter-01 branch

     style="width: 55%;">

2.  Publish the new chapter-01 branch

<img src="Images/publish_ch_1_branch.png" 
     alt="GitHub Desktop screen where blue 'Publish branch' button is present and circled in red."
     style="width: 55%;">

3.  Create a pull request

     alt="GitHub Desktop screen after committing changes to new branch, prompted to click 'Create Pull Request' button in blue."
     style="width: 55%;">

You will be relocated to the **GitHub browser**.

1.  Add your mentor as a reviewer (**Note**: here I use ‘hbeale’ but
    make sure you are adding *your* mentor’s GitHub id)

<img src="Images/add_reviewer_to_pull_request.png" 
     alt="GitHub browser screen upon creating a pull request. On the righthand side, a reviewer is added. The example shows 'hbeale' as reviewer, circled in red."
     style="width: 55%;">

Now your mentor can review your work while making some suggested
changes, where needed. After your mentor does this, when you return to
GitHub Desktop and are under the ‘chapter-01’ branch, you will see your
saved, unchanged work in **green** and your mentor’s changes (or any new
changes you have made too) in **red**. The red signifies *any* new
change that has not been committed and pushed to a branch.
