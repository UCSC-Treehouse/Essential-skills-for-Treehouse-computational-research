# Intro to Computational Research

#### *Onboarding Repository*

Welcome to your introductory guide to computational research!

This guide has been created to walk you through basic software downloads and installations as well as highlighted chapters of the ["R for Data Science"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) book.

This guide was created by the [Vaske Lab](https://vaskelab.ucsc.edu) at UC Santa Cruz; all software links reflect current version as of Q2 2024).

## Background

## Goals

In order for science to be valid, it has to be reproducible. 
Luckily, this can be easier for computational biology experiments than in wet lab experiments. 

Before you can work on a Treehouse computational project, you must demonstrate that you know how to perform reproducible experiments. 
When you have completed the work described in this repo, please reach out to your mentor so you can proceed with your project. 

-   Using Terminal, GitHub, RStudio, renv, and Quarto notebooks
-   Building repositories, files, and pipelines
-   Getting a hang of research computing workflows
-   Learning computational research skills in R including: data visualization, data transformation, and program iteration
